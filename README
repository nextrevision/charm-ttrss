Tiny-Tiny RSS Charm

Overview
--------

This charm provides Tiny-Tiny RSS (http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki). Taken from the main project site:

Tiny Tiny RSS is an open source web-based news feed (RSS/Atom) reader and aggregator, designed to allow you to read news from any location, while feeling as close to a real desktop application as possible.

Usage
-----

Instructions on using the charm:

    juju deploy mysql
    juju deploy tt-rss
    
    juju add-relation tt-rss mysql
    
    juju expose tt-rss

You can then browse to http://ip-address/tt-rss to configure the service. The default username and password are "admin/password". 

Configuration
-------------

Currently, there are three variables avialable: fqdn, update-tasks, and update-interval. The 'fqdn' variable should be set to the FQDN used by the end user to access the tt-rss instance. The 'update-interval' and 'update-tasks' correspond to the feed update daemon running in the background. Set the interval to how often, in seconds, you would like your feeds to be updated and the tasks to how many spawned instances of the updater you desire (i.e. more feeds might require more tasks). Below is the relevant config section: 

fqdn:
  type: string
  default: localhost
  description: FQDN of the server
update-tasks:
  type: int
  default: 2
  description: number of feed update tasks to spawn
update-interval:
  type: int
  default: 300
  description: frequency to check for feed updates
