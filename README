Tiny-Tiny RSS Charm

Overview
--------

This charm provides Tiny-Tiny RSS (http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki). Taken from the main project site:

Tiny Tiny RSS is an open source web-based news feed (RSS/Atom) reader and aggregator, designed to allow you to read news from any location, while feeling as close to a real desktop application as possible.

Usage
-----

Instructions on using the charm:

    juju deploy tt-rss
    juju deploy mysql
    
    juju add-relation tt-rss mysql
    
    juju expose tt-rss

You can then browse to http://ip-address/tt-rss to configure the service. The default username and password are "admin/password". 

Configuration
-------------

Currently, only two configuration options are available: FQDN and URL. The FQDN is used within the application itself and the URL parameter dictates where, on deployment, the tt-rss source should be downloaded from. The options are detailed below:

fqdn:
	type: string
	default: localhost
	description: FQDN of the server running tt-rss
url:
    type: string
    default: https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS/archive/1.7.8.tar.gz
    description: URL to download the tt-rss tarball
